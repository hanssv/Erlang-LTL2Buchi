To keep the size of the repository small, and to avoid all licensing issues, the
reference implementations Wring and LTL2Buchi are not included in the repository!

You can get them from:
- ftp://vlsi.colorado.edu/pub/Wring-1.1.0.tar.gz
- http://javapathfinder.sourceforge.net/ (LTL2Buchi is part of the JavaPathfinder)

Put Wring in a directory called 'Wring' and the ltl2buchi.jar in a directory called 
LTL2Buchi to use them with the wrappers in this directory!
